## 🌱 About

**ImSurajx-LearnGround** is my personal **learning organization**, built to document, practice, and experiment across all areas of **Full-Stack Development**, **DSA**, and **modern technologies**.  
Each repository here reflects a phase of my learning — from foundational frontend projects to advanced experiments and AI integrations.

This space acts as my **digital playground**, separate from my main GitHub profile, which focuses on **polished, production-ready projects**.
